# Bot Discord 'PeacefulBot'

Welcome to the PeacefulBot GitHub repository! This bot is designed to improve interaction and management within your Discord server. With a variety of commands ranging from social interaction to moderation, PeacefulBot is here to make your Discord experience more enjoyable and efficient.

## Main feature
The main goal being to establish peace within the different servers where PeacefulBot is installed, there is a warning and ban system according to the insults written in a channel. 
  
If you write 1 insult which can offense someone, you will get **warned** by PM.  
If you write 2 insults which can offense someone, you will get **banned** from the server and you will receive a PM to inform your ban.  
If you feel that you're banned for no serious reason, feel free to contact the owner.  

## Fun-features

PeacefulBot offers a range of features divided into several categories:

- **Interactions**: High-five, cuddle, or tease your friends with animated GIFs.  Just use some commands like `/hug`, `/highfive`, etc.
- **Economy**: Manage a virtual economy on your server with commands like `daily`, `roulette`, and `solde`.
- **Moderation**: Make managing your server easier with moderation commands like `ban`, `clear`, `role`, `unban`, and `warn`.
